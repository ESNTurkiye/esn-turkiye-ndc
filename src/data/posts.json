    "content": "\nIn my experience, one of the main challenges of applying for a visa in Türkiye is the length and complexity of the entire process. From the very beginning, students face long waiting times. For instance, while I received my appointment within a week, I know many students who had to wait up to a month just to get an appointment date.\n\nDocument preparation is another major difficulty. In the case of the Czech Republic, the embassy accepts documents only if they are translated into Czech — not even English. As a result, I had to spend approximately 3,600 TL on certified translations. This is further complicated by the fact that there is only one authorised translator in Türkiye whose translations are accepted by the embassy.\n\nAfter submitting all the documents, students may have to wait up to 60 days for a decision. Such long delays can seriously affect Erasmus students, as they risk arriving late to the host country, missing courses, or even losing the Erasmus opportunity altogether.\n\nOverall, the visa process in Türkiye is lengthy and uncertain, often taking at least three months in total. This creates enormous stress for students and makes academic mobility significantly more difficult."

With the tight deadline, I also had to arrange transportation and purchase tickets quickly, which added even more stress and extra effort to the process."

    },
    "content": "\nIn 2023, I set out on a journey driven by a dream: leaving my university in Türkiye and moving to Italy after being accepted by two Italian universities.\n\nThe admission process, entrance exams, and enrollment procedures were surprisingly quick and straightforward. What I didn’t know, however, was that for Turkish students, the real challenge often begins after acceptance: the visa process.\n\nBefore applying for a student visa, I rented an apartment through an intermediary company for €600. I paid the security deposit, two months’ rent, and included all official housing documents in my visa application file. Shortly after, I applied for an Italian government scholarship for international students and was accepted. The scholarship amounted to approximately €8000 per year and I added these official documents to my application as well.\n\nIn addition, I demonstrated more than the required amount of funds in my bank account, as requested by Italian authorities. I also submitted extensive proof of my family’s financial assets, including property deeds and ownership documents. Despite meeting and exceeding every requirement, I unexpectedly received my first visa rejection.\n\nAt that point, reapplying was not a choice but a necessity. My university enrollment was complete, my rental contract was signed, my flight tickets were purchased — everything was ready except the visa. I was fully prepared to build my life in Italy.\n\nFor my second application, I sought professional help from an Italian-Turkish lawyer who had graduated from a university in Italy. This time, all my documents were reinforced with Italian translations and detailed legal explanations. However, after months of waiting, I received another rejection — once again citing “insufficient financial means.”\n\nBy the time I received the second rejection, it was already November, and my academic year had begun. Since many students were still waiting for visas, the university had opened online education options, and I attended all my courses remotely. Still, the reality was devastating.\n\nNearly a year and a half of preparation, effort, and financial sacrifice — both mine and my family’s — was wasted. Beyond the financial losses, the emotional impact was far more severe. I no longer had a school to attend. I lost two years of my academic life and was forced to return to the very beginning, preparing for everything all over again.\n\nTo be honest, the aftermath of this process led me into a deep depression. The extreme stress triggered several health issues, and I struggled both mentally and physically. I was treated unfairly; my right to education was taken away. The work I put in, along with my family’s financial support, disappeared despite doing everything “by the book.”"

    "content": "\nMy Erasmus journey began with a busy and demanding period of collecting documents for the visa application and constantly monitoring appointment availability. Since there was no consulate or intermediary application centre in the city where I live, I had to travel to another city to submit my documents and attend the in-person appointment. This added extra expenses for transportation and accommodation.\n\nThe limited availability of appointment dates, combined with rejections due to minor technical details, forced me to retake biometric photographs, reprint documents, and pay for increased insurance and travel costs. All of this made the process both financially and administratively challenging. \n\nDespite these difficulties, managing every step — from receiving the acceptance letter to finally getting the visa approval — became one of the most exciting parts of the experience.\n\nAfter arriving, thanks to the guidance and support of several friends, including ESN members, my city, and the laboratory where I would complete my internship, my daily routine gradually took shape. I participated in orientations, events, and various international social activities such as international dinner nights, which helped me build a diverse international network.\n\nThroughout this experience, I learned how to balance academic responsibilities with social life, adapt to different cultures, improve my foreign language skills, and communicate more effectively. Looking back, all these stages — including the visa process that required relocating to another city and covering additional costs — transformed Erasmus from a simple exchange programme into a comprehensive learning experience. \n\nIt taught me planning, navigating urban transportation, overcoming challenges, and adapting to real-life conditions. I returned as a very different person from when I first left — feeling much more confident and self-assured."

I had to collect all the necessary documents, deposit enough money into my bank account, book plane tickets, make reservations for my accommodation, write a motivation letter, and travel to another city to submit the documents. \n\nIt was an incredibly tiring process both financially and emotionally as a university student, but I was happy to have the chance to visit a foreign country for the meeting.\n\nSurprisingly, I received a refusal from the visa office just two weeks later. The reason stated was: “Since I did not prove enough that I was not going to stay there illegally.” I was not accepted by the country. \n\nIt was a huge disappointment for me because I had collected all the necessary documents and had two official invitation letters from the communities that invited me. I strongly believe it is unfair to be refused even when you provide complete documentation and invitations. \n\nI became very discouraged about visa applications and lost hope for my future travels. I hope these visa issues will be resolved soon so we can travel without facing such unfair obstacles."

    },
    "content": "\nHello everyone. First of all, I wanted to write a short piece to share my visa process with you. I hope you find it useful.\n\nTo begin with, I would like to talk a little about what the concept of a visa represents to me. Frankly, it reminds me of an intense, challenging, long-term process made up of many mental thresholds. This is exactly why I chose the title **Overcoming Invisible Barriers**: because I see the visa not as a simple preparation for travel or an event, but as a psychological process — overcoming a phenomenon in itself.\n\nOne of the reasons that pushed me to write this text was the hope of helping readers feel, even slightly, that they are not alone, that they are not the only ones in the world going through this process, and of easing, at least a little, the sense of isolation that often accompanies it by sharing my feelings.\n\nI would like to talk a little about myself. Before moving on to my experiences, let me introduce myself: I am a third-year law student, and so far I have faced the visa process three times. With each visa application, I learned very different things and gained very different experiences, so I would like to briefly go through them.\n\nDuring my first visa application, I was a first-year university student and my purpose was tourism. I applied for a short-term tourist Schengen visa to Greece. At that time, the process went very smoothly because I worked with an office that provided visa consultancy services. However, as I later realised in my subsequent applications, unless it is absolutely necessary, working with visa offices often does not make a significant difference. \n\nThe thing that challenged me the most was the time limitations on documents. This made me realise how important it was to pay attention to the validity periods of each document individually. The waiting period was very exciting, but I did not encounter any problems with my first visa; the process was neither long nor troublesome. When I finally received my first visa, I was genuinely very happy; even though it was short-term, I felt that it would open other doors for me in the future.\n\nFor my second visa, I applied for a one-semester study period under the Erasmus Study Mobility programme to Portugal. Everything about this process was completely different. Portugal did not work with any visa centres, which can sometimes work to the applicant’s advantage. Since I was applying for a long-term national visa, the document list was very heavy. At some point, you may genuinely feel like giving up or become very anxious. \n\nMy advice is this: do not lose your motivation. If there are no serious issues, consulates do try to help you. Carefully check the required documents, submit them on time, and continuously review and close any gaps. Motivation letters are also very important — I always submit one as a supplementary document. In this application, I had no missing documents, encountered no issues, and was not asked for any additional paperwork. I managed to complete my second visa process without any problems.\n\nMy third visa application made me very nervous because while participating in the Erasmus programme, I had visited Liechtenstein and received a tourist office stamp in my passport. This time, I was applying for a cultural visa to attend a seminar in Croatia. The entire application process and all documents were in Turkish, which surprised me. \n\nLet me offer a humble piece of advice: do not have anything stamped in your passport other than official stamps. Also, please do not panic if the consulate asks for additional documents. Complete them calmly and thoroughly — in most cases, this is done to help you. \n\nThroughout all these processes, the anxiety I experience with every visa application was intense, especially because we are not citizens of a European Union member state. Some authorities may request documents that are neither necessary nor required. You are constantly asked questions like: Will you return to your country? What will you do once you return? Being psychologically strong in such moments is very important.\n\nAnother major frustration is the lack of available appointments, the high cost, and the long duration of the processes. One of my biggest misconceptions was believing that most people had good intentions and were willing to help each other. What truly matters is choosing your companions in this process wisely.\n\nIf there were a few things I wish I had known before applying for a visa, they would be these: First of all, you are not alone. Always seek accurate information and do not believe everything you hear.\n\nAfter three visa experiences, these are my feelings and lessons. I hope I have written things that may be useful to you. I encourage you to be patient, not to isolate yourself, and to research thoroughly.\n\nThank you for reading."

    },
    "content": "\nGetting a Polish visa in Türkiye was extremely challenging for me, mainly due to the appointment system. Applications are submitted through visa centres, and the most difficult part of the entire process is simply securing an appointment. Very often, appointments do not open at all, and when they do, all available slots are taken within seconds.\n\nI monitored the visa centre’s system for almost two months but was unable to obtain an appointment. In the end, I was forced to use an agency. Later, I realised that many agencies rely on automated systems (bots) to snatch appointments. These agencies charge very high fees — I paid 500 euros, while others paid even more. It was particularly disappointing to see students being financially exploited during such a stressful process.\n\nDue to the limited number of available appointments, some applicants are required to travel to other cities such as Trabzon or Gaziantep. In my case, this would have meant more than 16 hours of travel by car.\n\nAnother major difficulty is the visa centre’s website itself. When you check for appointments frequently, your access is often temporarily blocked for several hours or even days — especially during the times when new slots are expected to open. As a result, many applicants feel forced to use multiple accounts. Even when you finally manage to get an appointment and complete all the information, the system sometimes logs you out at the payment stage, which is a very common complaint among students.\n\nIt is important to note that these difficulties relate mainly to obtaining an appointment. Once I submitted my application at the consulate with a complete set of documents, the process itself did not present any significant problems."
